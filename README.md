- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @abbylochness
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in low level programming languages, preferably above assembly though. I like optimising systems, and programming hits the spot just right. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement network configuration at home.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: My main keyboard layout is colemak, though the non-alpha characters can change position depending on the keyboard.
